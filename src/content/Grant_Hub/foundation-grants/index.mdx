The Foundation Grants Allocator runs a program for any projects working in, assisting with, or supporting the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem. The program operates in phases, where each phase attracts applications from specific areas within the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem.

If your project does not meet the criteria for the current phase, we kindly invite you to consider [alternative grant programs](/grant-hub) within the Arbitrum ecosystem that might be a better fit for your project.

### How much funding should I request?

Arbitrum Foundation grants are distributed in ARB tokens.
We generally provided grants from 20,000 USD to 150,000 USD. Please refer to the Grant Tracks for more details on how much funding you can request.
For any larger grant requests, we kindly invite you to apply to the DAO governance process via a non-constitutional proposal for a grant from DAO Treasury.

### Current Phase Categories

The Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program provides funding for projects building :

- Decentralised applications (dApps) potentially, bringing millions of users into Web3, directly improving user experience and onchain activity by using the Arbitrum tech stack : Arbitrum One, Nova, <a href="https://arbitrum.io/orbit" target="_blank">Orbit</a> or <a href="https://arbitrum.io/stylus">Stylus</a>. Note: for projects that fall outside of the scope of the Arbitrum Foundation program, i.e. infrastructure, education, events, or community projects, we invite you to consider [alternative grant programs](/grant-hub) within the Arbitum ecosystem.
- and that are in late development stages (on Arbitrum testnet or mainnet) with initial signs of tractions. Note: the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program currently does not support projects that are in planning, idea stage or pre-testnet stages. If this is the case we invite you to consider [alternative grant programs](/grant-hub) within the Arbitum ecosystem.

<div class="bg-primary-light p-5 mb-5 lg:mb-10  rounded-lg">
#### Phase Three (April 2024 - June 2024)

In the current phase, we are welcoming applications from dApps building on Arbitrum One, Nova, Orbit or Stylus.
Phase 3 is set to close at the end of June. This phase will continue to focus on dApps and also introduce a more standardized approach to grants: grant tracks. Depending on the stage, growth projection, and type, a project will fall under a specific grant track. Each grant track will consist of defined goals and amounts, increasing the overall transparency and fairness of our program. More information about our grant tracks will be provided soon.
