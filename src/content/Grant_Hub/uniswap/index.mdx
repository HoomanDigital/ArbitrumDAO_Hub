### Mission of the UAGP

The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to:

- Fund High-Impact Projects: The program allocates grants specifically to projects that demonstrate the potential for substantial positive impact on the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems with grants from 50,000 to 250,000 $ARB.
- Strengthen the Uniswap and Arbitrum Ecosystems: The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to strengthen the ties and facilitate exchange between the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.
- Ensure Transparency and Community Input: The program mandates regular progress reports and seeks community feedback to influence the direction of funded projects.

### Project Allocation & Support

UAGP team approach to grant allocation focuses on achieving high impact, which we believe comes from bigger, more substantial projects:

- ocus on $50-250k High-Impact Projects: Our grant allocation strategy prioritizes projects with the potential for significant impact. We concentrate our financial support in the $50,000 to $250,000 ARB range; thereby, project funding requirements will be denominated in USD to mitigate the risk of ARB volatility for builders and guarantee secure financial planning.
- Providing Non-financial Support: Offer more than just funding by assisting selected projects with selective strategic guidance, and other key areas that contribute to long-term success.
- Discord Support Channel: We aim to establish a dedicated Discord channel for project to project exchange and bi-monthly office hours for direct support interactions.

### Budget

The Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) has allocated a total budget of $1,100,000. Within this budget, $924,000 is designated for expected grants to be awarded, covering the costs of projects within the ecosystem. Additionally, the program has set aside $176,000 for operations, including a maximum compensation of $156,000. A portion of the budget, $20,000, is reserved for tooling, subscriptions, and miscellaneous expenses. This comprehensive budgeting approach ensures the effective allocation of resources to support the growth and development of projects within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem.
